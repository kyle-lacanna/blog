            <p>This week in class I learned about transitions and how to make drop down menus.
                I found this to be very interesting and showed me the first steps to creating a modern website.
                On my own time however I looked more into transitions to see if I could do any cool things with them.
                One example can be shown if you hover over this image...
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pics">
            <img class="nice" src="nice.jpeg" width="400">
            <img class="scary" src="scary.jpeg" width="400" height="267">
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Okay I will admit that was alittle mean but it showcased how I was able to switch an image from on to another
                 by using opacity, positioning, and hover. To do this I played around on my own for a bit to try and get it to work
                  and I finally got it. There probably is a better way to do this but for now I wanted to just use what I knew already.
                <br><br>
                Now however, I will actually show the transition that I learned in class and researched on my own. The first thing I learned about
                 my own is the transition delays. With this I can make something happen alittle after an event. For instance if I wanted to make a ripple
                  effect on a mouse click this might come in handy. To show these transitions I will use examples with text and images.

                The last thing I wanted to showcase that I learned on my own this week was simple animations.
                The animation below shows a box changing colors and moving around the screen.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <div class="animation"></div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p> The following is the code that allows the animation to work!</p>
            <img class="code" src="code.png" width="400px">
        </div>
        
        <div class="links">

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp"> <h4>Animations</h4></a></li>
