        <h1>Week 1 Blog (8/30 - 9/3)</h1>
        <p>
            This week in Web Dev, I learned the basics of HTML and the basics of setting up a basic web server.
        </p>
        <p>
            In HTML I learned how to do basics like create a HTML page and a few things to help structure the HTML document such as bulleted lists and numbered lists.
            I also took it upon myself to learn alittle CSS because the origional webpage looked like it was from the 90's.
            In doing this I learned basic things like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Changing the background color</li>
            <li>Changing the font type</li>
            <li>Changing the font size</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In addiion to this I learned how to make text scroll by itself.
        </p>

        <h4>An example of this:</h4>


        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="up">I'm going up!</marquee>

        <p>
            I also learned to embed pictures like this picture of the code to make the text scroll!
        </p>

        <img src="scrollshot.jpg" alt="picture_of_code" width="500" height="75">

        <p>
            Clearly these are very basic skills that a 5 year old can do with a calculator but my skills are not as advanced as that yet :P.
            In this class I hope to take my skills from a 90's website to a modern website that is enjoyable to look at and navigate.
            The most important thing I learned this week though was that as a student you get a-ton of free stuff from GitHub.
