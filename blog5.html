                This week for my blog I wanted to learn how to do something neat in JavaScript.
                I first looked up cool things to do in JS but saw a buch of really complicated things.
                Then I remembered about the date object we used in one of the labs and looked up things I could do with that.
                I then saw it has a field for hour minute and seconds and decided to make a clock.
                The clock could be implemented on a store website for when the release something or be used for a New Years
                Eve Clock to watch for midnight. To do this was fairly simple and used a function that created a new date object and then formatted a string
                with the hours, minutes, and seconds. I then updated the div in the html body and it shows the updated
                time on the page. Below is the live clock I implemented.
            </p>
            <div id="ClockDisplay" class="clock" onload="timer()"></div>
            <br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <p>
                I am still trying to learn more JavaScript and how it can be used but I thought this was really cool.
                I would have done more with it but unfotunatly this week I was very limited on time with a bunch of job interviews that I needed to attend throughout the state.
            </p>

                Below is some of the code that I used to help make the clock...
