        <h2>Final Blog Post - Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout this course I have learn alot of new things. However it was not a very easy road to take.
            I think that it would benifit both the students and the professors to split this in to two classes.
            The first one would focus on the basics of html, css, and java script and allows students to become very familiar with that. 
            The second would jump into react after a small review. This second class would go much more indepth with react and show other things 
            such as how to do login pages and things that most websites have today. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I would also have quizzes each week on basic 
            things we learned to make sure students are following the concepts and have a required question in there for the muddy points. 
            If its not worth something students wont always do it, because of laziness or their workload.

            For me in this experience I was able to pickup the html and css very easily but then once we got into javascript
             I kinda lost it. It took a while to be able to process everything but I finally had some sort of understanding. 
             The same can be said with React but if I waited the class would have been over by the time I got the concept down. What really helped 
             me was coming into the office and going over the dukebox lab in depth and following the execution of when things happen. After that it all
              clicked together and I felt very confident in what I would be able to do. I think that if there was a day to "dumb it down" and walk through a
             basic program like that in class everyone would be able to understand it and class time after that would be more effeciently used.
